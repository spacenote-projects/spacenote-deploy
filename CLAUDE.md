# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

**PROTOTYPE MODE** - This project is in active prototype development. Breaking changes are acceptable and expected. Do not maintain backward compatibility when making improvements.

## Critical Guidelines

1. **Always communicate in English** - Regardless of the language the user speaks, always respond in English. All code, comments, and documentation must be in English.

2. **Minimal documentation** - Only add comments/documentation when it simplifies understanding and isn't obvious from the code itself. Keep it strictly relevant and concise.

3. **Critical thinking** - Always critically evaluate user ideas. Users can make mistakes. Think first about whether the user's idea is good before implementing.
